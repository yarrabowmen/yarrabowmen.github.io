## Visiting Archers

If you already have a membership with an Archery Australia affiliated club, you can shoot at Yarra Bowmen once you have shown **evidence of current financial membership** in your home club. To ensure access, best check with committee members if anyone is at the premises when you arrive. You can make contact via [our Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/YarraBowmenBulleen) beforehand. Sunday mornings are also relatively reliable times to meet members, weather permitting. On arrival, please pay the **daily shooting fee of $10** through a member or the money box next to the fridge.

## Temporary Players

If you are not yet a member of an archery club, you have to provide **evidence of basic competence**, e.g. a certificate of an introductory archery course. Again, you have to ensure members are at the club when you arrive, which you can do via the [Yarra Bowmen Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/YarraBowmenBulleen). Once a member has ascertained that you are competent and aware of safety procedures, you can sign a **temporary player form** for insurance purposes. You can then pay the **$10 daily shooting fee**. This does not include any equipment hire. If you need equipment, please get in touch before you arrive.

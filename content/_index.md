Yarra Bowmen was established on 30th October 1963 – we are one of Victoria’s oldest target archery clubs and registered with [Archery Victoria](http://archeryvic.org.au/). Situated in Bulleen Park, we are an excellent option for anyone near the CBD or the eastern suburbs of Melbourne. We are within easy reach of suburbs such as Doncaster, Doncaster East, Templestowe, Lower Templestowe, Bulleen, Heidelberg, Balwyn, Lower Plenty and more!

We are one of the few metropolitan archery clubs where members can shoot all-week during daylight hours.

The club has a 90m range which could fit 30+ targets, a large clubhouse and 2 storage sheds for targets.

Our beginners courses can accommodate people of varying abilities aged 10 years and older.

*As we are run entirely by volunteers* – your kind consideration in keeping our grounds neat and tidy will be greatly appreciated.

The club’s grounds and archery range areas are leased from the Manningham City Council. We acknowledge the kind support of the city council and are proud to be part of the local community.
